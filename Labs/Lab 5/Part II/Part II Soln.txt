Part II— a different class 
Consider class Set, which implements the notion of set (from set theory), with the following operations: 
Specify the preconditions and postconditions of these operations. 
(Recall that a set does not have duplicate elements.)


- insert(x)

	Pre: 
		- The Set is not full (even though virtually impossible)
		- The Set does not already contain object x

	Post: 		
		- The Set is not empty
		- Assuming that before the call, Set.size()- maximum = 1, the Set is now full.
		- Assuming that before the call, Set.size()- maximum > 1, the Set is now partially full.

- remove(x)

	Pre: 
		- The Set is not empty
		- The Set contains object x

	Post: 		
		- The Set is not full
		- Assuming the Set was full, now the Set has one less item than the max.
		- Assumming the number of objects in the Set was one, the Set is now empty.

- isIn(x)

	Pre: 
		- N/A

	Post: 		
		- The number of elements in the Set does not increase of decrease
